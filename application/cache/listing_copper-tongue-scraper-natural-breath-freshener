            "description": "<p>A healthy mouth is an indicator of overall physical well-being. Not only does fresh breath, clean teeth and strong gums help put forth a healthful appearance but these are signs of wellness in the&nbsp;body. When combined with&nbsp;regular brushing and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cakeweather.com/blogs/news/flossing\" title=\"Stay Flossing - Health Benefits of Flossing\" rel=\"nofollow\">flossing</a>, a&nbsp;copper tongue scraper can help&nbsp;keep your mouth clean and healthy. &nbsp;</p><p>For those new to tongue scraping, this is&nbsp;an age old Ayurvedic technique that promotes daily cleaning&nbsp;of the tongue to monitor health, remove bacteria and stimulate the body's processes.&nbsp;We recommend scraping before brushing your teeth. You can use the scraper as often as&nbsp;preferred. Twice a day can help prevent build up&nbsp;from accumulating on the&nbsp;tongue. So skip bitter and expensive mouth washes and mints.</p><p>The copper scraper is long-lasting, durable, can handle repeated exposure to water and humidity and requires no replacement with normal use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NATURAL METHOD FOR BETTER ORAL CARE&nbsp;+ FRESHER BREATH&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Made of bacteria-resistant,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341460\" rel=\"nofollow\">anti-microbial</a>&nbsp;copper.</li><li>No harsh or artificial chemicals.</li><li>Cleans away bacteria and debris on tongue that&nbsp;a traditional toothbrush cannot.</li><li>Finished with smooth&nbsp;edges to painlessly collect and remove debris from tongue.</li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>WONDERFUL HEALTH + WELLNESS BENEFITS</strong></p><ul><li>Enjoy better smelling&nbsp;breath.</li><li>Enhances&nbsp;the tongue's ability to taste food and drink.</li><li>Improves appearance of tongue by removing film.</li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Directions</strong></p><ol><li>Hold scraper securely on each&nbsp;end.&nbsp;</li><li>Relax tongue. Place the rounded corner&nbsp;gently on the back of the&nbsp;tongue and pull the scraper forward using light pressure. (Be careful not to reach too far back into the mouth.)</li><li>Rinse debris from scraper under&nbsp;running water.</li><li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until tongue is clean.</li><li>Clean with soap&nbsp;and store&nbsp;scraper in a dry spot.</li></ol><p><strong>Care</strong></p><p>Wash well with soap before first use. Regular use will keep the copper glimmering. If copper becomes dull, rub&nbsp;a paste of salt, baking soda and vinegar over the scraper with a cloth or soft bristle toothbrush to restore shine.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong></p><p>Measures approximately 10\" from end to end.</p><p>This is a natural product so slight variations in shape and color may occur.</p>",
