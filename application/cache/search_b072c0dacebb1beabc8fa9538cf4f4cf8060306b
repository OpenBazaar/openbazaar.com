No previous knowledge in computer science, mathematics, \nprogramming, or cryptography is required. Terminology is explained \nthrough pictures, analogies, and metaphors.This book bridges the gap \nthat exists between purely technical books about the blockchain and \npurely business-focused books. It does so by explaining both the \ntechnical concepts that make up the blockchain and their role in \nbusiness-relevant applications.What You'll LearnWhat the blockchain is\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy it is needed and what problem it solves\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy there is so much excitement about the blockchain and its potential\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMajor components and their purpose\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow various components of the blockchain work and interact\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLimitations, why they exist, and what has been done to overcome them\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMajor\n application scenariosWho This Book Is For Everyone who wants to get a \ngeneral idea of what blockchain technology is, how it works, and how it \nwill potentially change the financial system as we know it\u003c/p\u003e","thumbnail":{"tiny":"zb2rhZRHbNQCWuEJTA3Ze1sBfWdHmCGtw2SmsGvpqLCgmMeQe","small":"zb2rhZsxSkGxKtGSDzNhn9FsVxvp68BM5rddKvJyyvd8eR5jm","medium":"zb2rhnPnK5YPqFVpf6wM7NS4MGzBkFpYZMFe4LkquZcaj9ESr","original":"zb2rhc1Cs3UYQgBgVwnqGYYorzRUVn7Byn7YXYQhmc8jGaZrh","large":"zb2rhkeb4dAMeTxr6b6J1PezVsr2V7K1rzxTCkwdvf4ELQC9b"},"language":"","price":{"currencyCode":"BTC","amount":29000},"nsfw":false,"averageRating":0,"ratingCount":0,"acceptedCurrencies":["BTC"],"coinType":"","coinDivisibility":0}},{"type":"listing","relationships":{"vendor":{"data":{"peerID":"QmakxNv9Y5YFuAuvjvx4mEda3TmFBaHDtacd1KtEL56mP4","name":"CryptoCollectibles","handle":"","location":"Blockchains and Webberverse","nsfw":false,"vendor":true,"moderator":false,"verifiedModerator":false,"about":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComic Books, Trades, Marvel, DC, Other Publishers, Single Issues, Sets, Runs, Collections, Autographed Items, Toys, Promotional Items, and Video Games\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll comics are shipped USPS Priority. \u0026nbsp;This includes Tracking and $50 of insurance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet up to 10 comics for one shipping cost! \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are ordering more than one comic book, just send a message using the OpenBazaar messaging system with what comic books you want to group together and we will generate a custom listing for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCheck out all our great reviews on our Etsy Store http://www.etsy.com/shop/CryptoCollectibles/reviews\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cem\u003ePLEASE PARDON OUR STARDUST AS THE STORE HAS \u003ca href=\"https://www.yours.org/content/hurricane-survivor-tips-by-bebop-and-boo-boo--hurricane-irma-survivors-47b0a9e6e43d/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSURVIVED A HURRICANE\u003c/a\u003e AND WE MOVE THINGS OVER FROM OPENBAZAAR 1.0 TO 2.0, THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE DURING THIS TRANSITION. \u0026nbsp;BASICALLY IMAGES AND CATEGORIES ARE A LITTLE WONKY. \u0026nbsp; I DIDN'T MEAN TO YELL, SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS, THANKS FOR CHECKING THE STORE OUT.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","shortDescription":"Blockchains Local Comic Shop","avatarHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhhus4hQpTbS3BYHvyhHcRbT8qvBHuEv4AtgD1jkC2oBNH","small":"zb2rhatvcGoep2LP4gv2CFWbnZF4Huo73JgT8A3bTbq83BMJ1","medium":"zb2rhkd9xfsM7V1wUL5sWguEF85U6mwhRiRG5TcLPsv18pi5v","original":"zb2rhkd9xfsM7V1wUL5sWguEF85U6mwhRiRG5TcLPsv18pi5v","large":"zb2rhcsyfmHCDvFypfJKZ8dXij8MenEeYynZYvUZKm6wiftzd"},"headerHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhbLVmugpRVc4uyH5uM35k6ihjku3dcCzA8NKXARpCZ1Rb","small":"zb2rhjsmyJ4h5KePDwWWu8YVea2NbCXNdrgE87H7h8fDPYeSN","medium":"zb2rhmr8TbqAMKh8eK98MEUijJeN6kh7XAvLbsz1hdXi1TXRf","original":"zb2rhoBtQaMVhauCrL2MovADpzRaWtNNkcyBBwbJNPTP91GPr","large":"zb2rhf5GzGmmZ8ejUYnZtouWjaLEWqFx3jN945PpjF2qh9cG9"},"userAgent":"/openbazaar-go:0.11.0/","lastSeen":"2018-04-16T23:20:40.978328541Z","stats":{"followerCount":280,"followingCount":58,"listingCount":2129,"postCount":0,"ratingCount":2,"averageRating":5},"currencies":null}},"moderators":[]},"data":{"score":3.9627647,"hash":"","slug":"spawn-the-dark-ages-1-1999-comic-book","title":"Spawn: The Dark Ages #1 (1999) Comic Book","tags":null,"categories":["Comics - Other Publishers - Single Issue"],"contractType":"PHYSICAL_GOOD","description":"Spawn: The Dark Ages #1 (March 1999) by Image Comics\u003cbr /\u003eCover by Glenn Fabry and Liam McCormack-Sharp.

Take Leonard. He gets one look at you, and he sees what you're going to look like after you're dead. Then there's David. He can see weird things about you, too. Like what your fate is and what has to be done to make sure you don't dodge it. It's more than a talent, it's a life calling. David's in town because he knows about a kid with a gambling problem who is thinking about going clean ? and David wouldn't be doing a very good job if he let that happen. So, he steps across the line into society's dark underground, looking to set himself up with a good game of cards. This new mini-series defies genre, putting bets on both psychological horror and neo-noir for a comic book unlike any other. Written by Neal Shaffer and Daniel Krall, One Plus One is an auspicious debut by two creators with a unique eye for story.

I got interested in gemstones more recently when I found a beautiful green glassy stone the size of my thumb while walking down some old abandoned railroad tracks. When I found that stone, I thought, Wow! I need to do something with that!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince that time I started cutting, shaping, faceting and polishing the things I find. Everywhere I go I am always looking down at the ground hunting for more rocks. Naturally, after one acquires a multitude of crystals and glittery bling, one starts to wonder what to do with all these things. There was no way I could afford to buy settings for more than just a few of my best gems. Eventually I reasoned, if I can teach myself to facet a crystal I should be able to teach myself to make my own settings. So I took a class at the Littleton Studio School in Littleton, NH near where I live and learned to solder and work metal. I have slowly developed a style as I continue to learn and experiment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile all this was happening, bitcoin burst upon the scene. I got interested in mining bitcoins (being the digger of rocks that I am) and collecting some of the other blockchain currencies as a hedge against an ever shakier world economy.

In this fatal first issue by the creative team of Steve Niles (30 Days of Night, SIMON DARK) and Kelley Jones (BATMAN: RED RAIN), Batman will come face-to-face with the Master of Fear himself - but just what is the Scarecrow after?
