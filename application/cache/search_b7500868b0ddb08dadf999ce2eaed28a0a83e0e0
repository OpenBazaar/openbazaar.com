Miles O'Brien has returned to Earth. And Colonel Kira Nerys . is in charge of a station in crisis in STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE® ? N-VECTOR, a 4-issue WILDSTORM PRODUCTIONS miniseries that is the first new story to take place after the shocking DS9 series finale! Introducing new characters and situations that will appear in future Pocket Books novels and WILDSTORM comic books, N-VECTOR is a thrilling adventure opening new vistas in the Star Trek® universe. Written by novelist K.W. Jeter (Noir, Blade Runner: Replicant Night) with art and covers by Toby Cypress (MR. MAJESTIC) and Jason Martin (MR. MAJESTIC), N- VECTOR #1 takes place just weeks after the series' end, as several new, seemingly unrelated crises rear their head on the station. Quark becomes a soft touch ? lending money, not collecting what's owed him and, most startling, extending credit(!) ? a turn of events baffling to those who know the Ferengi. At the same time, Kira's investigation of sabotage on the station leads to an unlikely subject, one very close to Kira herself. Finally, Romulan researcher Mos Senay returns to DS9 after a long absence, continuing his secret xenobiological research. Things take a dark turn when someone begins collecting ? in brutal ways ? Quark's debts. Who is the mysterious figure whose identity is unknown even to Quark? And how does it connect to the sabotage and Mos Senay's experiments? All will be revealed in WildStorm's first DEEP SPACE NINE miniseries.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/b\u003e","thumbnail":{"tiny":"zb2rhe22jjvYbCDjGzh5f7ZkuUaUq5QgWFoXYrFWWhhhuPdgS","small":"zb2rhjHFdhQdY7cvnDxaKNG2hxXzdHWBN3jpSSgK5G3YLW9as","medium":"zb2rhkrR1ZfUkcSSEFkm8mJJKotSEQW5Hafj17pPWEA1BAFLF","original":"zb2rhYBwDmEqprBsVnmrbm9JmacSRHdcgw75hjkvFnSVv8EqQ","large":"zb2rhkDDrzQWJexaAudQgFR5ydiTmm5FhnpwYiNzQvZoNuzf4"},"language":"","price":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":300},"nsfw":false,"averageRating":0,"ratingCount":0,"shipsTo":["ALL","UNITED_STATES"],"acceptedCurrencies":["BTC"],"coinType":"","coinDivisibility":0}},{"type":"listing","relationships":{"vendor":{"data":{"peerID":"QmakxNv9Y5YFuAuvjvx4mEda3TmFBaHDtacd1KtEL56mP4","name":"CryptoCollectibles","handle":"","location":"Blockchains and Webberverse","nsfw":false,"vendor":true,"moderator":false,"verifiedModerator":false,"about":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComic Books, Trades, Marvel, DC, Other Publishers, Single Issues, Sets, Runs, Collections, Autographed Items, Toys, Promotional Items, and Video Games\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll comics are shipped USPS Priority. \u0026nbsp;This includes Tracking and $50 of insurance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet up to 10 comics for one shipping cost! \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are ordering more than one comic book, just send a message using the OpenBazaar messaging system with what comic books you want to group together and we will generate a custom listing for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCheck out all our great reviews on our Etsy Store http://www.etsy.com/shop/CryptoCollectibles/reviews\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cem\u003ePLEASE PARDON OUR STARDUST AS THE STORE HAS \u003ca href=\"https://www.yours.org/content/hurricane-survivor-tips-by-bebop-and-boo-boo--hurricane-irma-survivors-47b0a9e6e43d/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSURVIVED A HURRICANE\u003c/a\u003e AND WE MOVE THINGS OVER FROM OPENBAZAAR 1.0 TO 2.0, THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE DURING THIS TRANSITION. \u0026nbsp;BASICALLY IMAGES AND CATEGORIES ARE A LITTLE WONKY. \u0026nbsp; I DIDN'T MEAN TO YELL, SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS, THANKS FOR CHECKING THE STORE OUT.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","shortDescription":"Blockchains Local Comic Shop","avatarHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhhus4hQpTbS3BYHvyhHcRbT8qvBHuEv4AtgD1jkC2oBNH","small":"zb2rhatvcGoep2LP4gv2CFWbnZF4Huo73JgT8A3bTbq83BMJ1","medium":"zb2rhkd9xfsM7V1wUL5sWguEF85U6mwhRiRG5TcLPsv18pi5v","original":"zb2rhkd9xfsM7V1wUL5sWguEF85U6mwhRiRG5TcLPsv18pi5v","large":"zb2rhcsyfmHCDvFypfJKZ8dXij8MenEeYynZYvUZKm6wiftzd"},"headerHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhbLVmugpRVc4uyH5uM35k6ihjku3dcCzA8NKXARpCZ1Rb","small":"zb2rhjsmyJ4h5KePDwWWu8YVea2NbCXNdrgE87H7h8fDPYeSN","medium":"zb2rhmr8TbqAMKh8eK98MEUijJeN6kh7XAvLbsz1hdXi1TXRf","original":"zb2rhoBtQaMVhauCrL2MovADpzRaWtNNkcyBBwbJNPTP91GPr","large":"zb2rhf5GzGmmZ8ejUYnZtouWjaLEWqFx3jN945PpjF2qh9cG9"},"userAgent":"/openbazaar-go:0.11.0/","lastSeen":"2018-04-17T15:01:49.712845705Z","stats":{"followerCount":280,"followingCount":58,"listingCount":2129,"postCount":0,"ratingCount":2,"averageRating":5},"currencies":null}},"moderators":[]},"data":{"score":5.71258,"hash":"","slug":"hate-24-1996-comic-book","title":"Hate #24 (1996) Comic Book","tags":["hate","peter-bagge","independent-comics","comic-books","comics"],"categories":["Comics","Other Publishers","Other - Single Issues","Single Issues"],"contractType":"PHYSICAL_GOOD","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHate #24 (September 1996) by Fantagraphics Books\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBuddy tells Lisa to go get help for her emotional instability in \"Nothing that Twenty Years on the Couch Couldn't Cure.\" A lampooning of psychiatry, the story also has Buddy running into Tom Kaufman (a character not seen in years), who is now a police officer and a proud family man.

NOTE: Marvel begins their 25th Anniversary celebration with a new logo in top left corner of the front covers of their books for the next year.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","thumbnail":{"tiny":"zb2rhogWYW3dgZTTn9tSEv8qX1pQ85vkGKeWvRiLWAayUt44F","small":"zb2rhaLRZ1yb6Q7NVJoutnLtNdzctAGjeBtwZ5LnPvkjDwHxT","medium":"zb2rhYsrj7yNC33eE6du4Cm9Ta1da2wHufKLNiiR3keuBt5tr","original":"zb2rhc9zZ8pUNmDvArXHfMYVhee1tRFZFza8C4QQSardq9GPM","large":"zb2rhYTcCByVB8fsFaS55gJYpK4xt7SpvxcZdQjYJCDZfcBCt"},"language":"","price":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":300},"nsfw":false,"averageRating":0,"ratingCount":0,"shipsTo":["UNITED_STATES","ALL"],"acceptedCurrencies":["BTC"],"coinType":"","coinDivisibility":0}},{"type":"listing","relationships":{"vendor":{"data":{"peerID":"QmakxNv9Y5YFuAuvjvx4mEda3TmFBaHDtacd1KtEL56mP4","name":"CryptoCollectibles","handle":"","location":"Blockchains and Webberverse","nsfw":false,"vendor":true,"moderator":false,"verifiedModerator":false,"about":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComic Books, Trades, Marvel, DC, Other Publishers, Single Issues, Sets, Runs, Collections, Autographed Items, Toys, Promotional Items, and Video Games\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll comics are shipped USPS Priority. \u0026nbsp;This includes Tracking and $50 of insurance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet up to 10 comics for one shipping cost! \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are ordering more than one comic book, just send a message using the OpenBazaar messaging system with what comic books you want to group together and we will generate a custom listing for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCheck out all our great reviews on our Etsy Store http://www.etsy.com/shop/CryptoCollectibles/reviews\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cem\u003ePLEASE PARDON OUR STARDUST AS THE STORE HAS \u003ca href=\"https://www.yours.org/content/hurricane-survivor-tips-by-bebop-and-boo-boo--hurricane-irma-survivors-47b0a9e6e43d/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSURVIVED A HURRICANE\u003c/a\u003e AND WE MOVE THINGS OVER FROM OPENBAZAAR 1.0 TO 2.0, THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE DURING THIS TRANSITION. \u0026nbsp;BASICALLY IMAGES AND CATEGORIES ARE A LITTLE WONKY. \u0026nbsp; I DIDN'T MEAN TO YELL, SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS, THANKS FOR CHECKING THE STORE OUT.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","shortDescription":"Blockchains Local Comic Shop","avatarHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhhus4hQpTbS3BYHvyhHcRbT8qvBHuEv4AtgD1jkC2oBNH","small":"zb2rhatvcGoep2LP4gv2CFWbnZF4Huo73JgT8A3bTbq83BMJ1","medium":"zb2rhkd9xfsM7V1wUL5sWguEF85U6mwhRiRG5TcLPsv18pi5v","original":"zb2rhkd9xfsM7V1wUL5sWguEF85U6mwhRiRG5TcLPsv18pi5v","large":"zb2rhcsyfmHCDvFypfJKZ8dXij8MenEeYynZYvUZKm6wiftzd"},"headerHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhbLVmugpRVc4uyH5uM35k6ihjku3dcCzA8NKXARpCZ1Rb","small":"zb2rhjsmyJ4h5KePDwWWu8YVea2NbCXNdrgE87H7h8fDPYeSN","medium":"zb2rhmr8TbqAMKh8eK98MEUijJeN6kh7XAvLbsz1hdXi1TXRf","original":"zb2rhoBtQaMVhauCrL2MovADpzRaWtNNkcyBBwbJNPTP91GPr","large":"zb2rhf5GzGmmZ8ejUYnZtouWjaLEWqFx3jN945PpjF2qh9cG9"},"userAgent":"/openbazaar-go:0.11.0/","lastSeen":"2018-04-17T15:18:00.169581826Z","stats":{"followerCount":280,"followingCount":58,"listingCount":2129,"postCount":0,"ratingCount":2,"averageRating":5},"currencies":null}},"moderators":[]},"data":{"score":5.6019692,"hash":"","slug":"hate-22-1996-comic-book","title":"Hate #22 (1996) Comic Book","tags":["hate","comic-books","comics","peter-bagge","indie-comics"],"categories":["Comics","Single Issues","Other Publishers","Other - Single Issues"],"contractType":"PHYSICAL_GOOD","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHate #22 (March 1996) by Fantagraphics Books\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePops Bradley doesn't feel up to snuff in \"Dear Old Dad,\" an issue that is in poor taste, even for this series.
