If disputes cannot be agreed we will place in the hands of an OpenBazaar moderater to make a final decision.\n Our response time is usually within 24 hours from receipt of issue.\n",
        "termsAndConditions": "(Moderator)\nAs we all wish for OpenBazaar to become a trusted platform for both Buyers and Sellers it is imperative that both buyers and sellers remain trustworthy. \n\nAs Moderator I will allow you the Buyer and Seller 7 days to Provide all relevant transaction information. On the Part of the Buyer Screenshots and transaction ID's and on the part of the Seller proof of dispatch etc. If the Dispute cannot be resolved amicably as the Moderator I will step in and release funds as required.\n\nI am prepared to extend the 7 day deadline at the request of either party if provided with a valid reason, ie; Awaiting final delivery etc. If the seller remains inactive during the 7 day period I will release the funds minus Moderator fees to the Buyer.\n\nAn Overview of how OpenBazaar Moderator process works: \n\nHow Moderated Payments Work\nOpenBazaar uses 2-of-3 multisig addresses for moderated payments. When a buyer wants to purchase a listing, instead of sending the funds directly to the seller, he will send the funds to the multisig account. The three people who control this account are the buyer, the seller, and a trusted third party selected beforehand. We call these trusted third parties ‘moderators’.\n\nNow there are five possible ways for the funds to be released from the multisig address:\n\n1. The seller sends the product or delivers the service and the buyer is satisfied. The buyer and seller are the two of three parties needed for the multisig, and together they release the funds to the seller. This is what a normal transaction will look like.\n\n2. The seller cannot deliver the listing as promised or the buyer is unhappy with the listing, and they mutually agree to refund the buyer. Again, the buyer and seller are the two of three parties needed for the multisig. This time they join together and release the funds to the buyer.\n\n3. The buyer and seller are in a dispute and cannot agree how to release funds. The moderator comes in and decides that the seller is at fault. The moderator then joins with the buyer to release a refund to the buyer.\n\n4. The buyer and seller are in a dispute and cannot agree how to release funds. The moderator comes in and decides that the buyer is at fault. The moderator then joins with the seller and releases the funds to the seller.\n\n5. The buyer and seller are in a dispute and cannot agree how to release funds. The moderator comes in and decides that neither or both parties are at fault, and the moderator joins with either party to release funds in a split between buyer and seller.
