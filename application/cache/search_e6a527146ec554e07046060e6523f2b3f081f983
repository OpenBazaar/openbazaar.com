Trata-se de um livro curto: em poucas palavras, ele demonstra a perenidade de seus conceitos a respeito de política econômica, como propriedade privada, livre comércio, preços, juros, moeda e inflação, bem como os de sistemas político-econômicos, como capitalismo, intervencionismo, socialismo, investimento externo. Fruto de palestras dirigidas a empresários, professores e alunos, As seis lições foi organizado pela viúva de Mises, é um clássico da ciência econômica em linguagem acessível para o público leigo e é provavelmente o livro mais vendido do autor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCapa comum:\u003c/strong\u003e 112 páginas\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEditora:\u003c/strong\u003e Mises;\u0026nbsp;\u003cspan\u003e7ª\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEdição \u0026nbsp;(1 de janeiro de 2016)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISBN-10:\u003c/strong\u003e 8562816019\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISBN-13:\u003c/strong\u003e 978-8562816017\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDimensões do livro:\u003c/strong\u003e 15,2 x 0,6 x 22,9 cm\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePeso do livro:\u003c/strong\u003e 218 g\u003c/p\u003e","thumbnail":{"tiny":"zb2rhXHuPoVJNYZ41uzKs9j9nYkuB3q6AGXACXZJfeN4XfHnn","small":"zb2rhdaVzX6cZxg9fVRYcgZRJmMwj9ZpskexkQmY5QhvZqeYb","medium":"zb2rha4GWA9yyvVano9Te6GkLCJdKRVhsEjUWVWCpSCqV3pwM","original":"zb2rhhNWA3cYCCtGBrnfmTojsqAP9k545mUuRdvQ7cDYCRxmy","large":"zb2rhoV6jJYNrnVSQiPYdET7nDpfcqvT7qVKf1YV18PXFxc6c"},"language":"","price":{"currencyCode":"BRL","amount":2700},"nsfw":false,"averageRating":5,"ratingCount":1,"shipsTo":["BRAZIL"],"freeShipping":["BRAZIL"],"acceptedCurrencies":["BTC"],"coinType":"","coinDivisibility":0}},{"type":"listing","relationships":{"vendor":{"data":{"peerID":"QmaWDDjrLd4r9NFJaFfCfMXyt4HAao75vq46WsaYgtbRPo","name":"Alexandria's Book Store","handle":"","location":"USA","nsfw":false,"vendor":true,"moderator":true,"verifiedModerator":false,"about":"","shortDescription":"Used books for sale or trade","avatarHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rha1TCiTJf1MFh1HaoBA9y7KicMFtASdyA6JVXkPWrGhee","small":"zb2rhkPapBhAzWuhsENjTntuwtXucuRESQUWcmXMPsN2tuUYd","medium":"zb2rhmqmSqbPGxsCng4y9Vm64J83CcpdYicHpiBEeMGmvJ4YQ","original":"zb2rhmTN21xrQomeGTzTqw3ZMR5wS32m1RBi1T6VidXx6NekB","large":"zb2rhYV8HtsmorqUs4rvwqsxXdjWW4ncPXkzNQNgbyKbsEvDm"},"headerHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhhzzn21PhnYZfu5KeFq7DEcZa72Wn5SbcPQVsxnQizewm","small":"zb2rheRfFiCJi7KbmBXq2sZRbXGifbg953SeJvrhvgR6b72dq","medium":"zb2rhZREb8XpRS5ADHVC9N9JPKpidZ11i5g4nG1JPmYYD2Hb8","original":"zb2rhbqPn748wZMaQTjMJWmshpDjLLGJAQZ4Ny66ZBhLRRTkc","large":"zb2rhXgko3mF4J81c9fkh67T3kLmgUrTc5x7rVAbQu5eHQATr"},"userAgent":"/openbazaar-go:0.11.1/","lastSeen":"2018-04-17T13:23:05.792443953Z","stats":{"followerCount":288,"followingCount":562,"listingCount":13,"postCount":0,"ratingCount":8,"averageRating":5},"currencies":["BTC"]}},"moderators":["QmYCHm2aqVzjnSCdY7SRc6k7spxi22tZ5rCMH8yuMeBvx2","QmVrEZBfrmTZbCkPeTFzkU9NCtFVnx2KShuu1kvA2NFLtB","QmU1uQ2aVVJghFCKkEZ8MURUG9gpUbveKic9Xrmcstrf7h","QmRq8zwc7U9oVY22H9GSWyXZ8ehYge4Ube1k4ABTqAMMHN","QmdaEVBDtqhw6JGqnvFW5iKteZe2Z4kpVcVyvQbj62kPzw","QmScF5n99EHZvgiNTc3ygXQc3PvwN6CXi1rkBgE3nEQFwK","QmdhCMFKrMXYbe65wLPAAeb9xx9BbyuuPsUPiG8GgHG3fn","QmXnPwrTJy2De1pkMLqjChYdnsSCvbFKdViPB1JrNY6UxS","QmZDysj3jfs1oCCRRBn4SGALVRjH7BkfChBEBB96116ayx","QmVB42zLCzJqHznT5ostfsG9xuVAXzPWRioijogCXzAkxQ","QmefQxryGcTff2FkVxZcotGTEiwoTbKzweN6VSi36KzJ1Q","QmWcK44gbN24DxrJH8qC9iS1Agt4jQa47PKW7QqtQEwD6e","QmeRw4K4s5HvWmYZhTdDt8mdr5rf6MCNZHW51T8ZmKKF9g","QmPeo9Qjd84ZAuRZPw4CfYwvQF58LobzKdAyu4WKX7jLZr","QmX9pcW7Wyw6k4mU4XTwZYR6HRH2aqK5LV7wQwDwJm4Nh1","QmUsV4aGYjNA2XRKMBEeGi9LvYHWp4613RPEdBwK5Utvgv","QmfCtcdJkoH6YMQCKpxS6Wi1zn3Gj3LQvb2kkxjKJGWk8C","QmYET6geiPcchDFR79bAGsTBrBMqULQwR8NctJh9mAT3Kh"]},"data":{"score":0,"hash":"","slug":"signed-hardcover-the-bitcoin-big-bang-by-brian-kelly","title":"(Signed Hardcover) The Bitcoin Big Bang by Brian Kelly","tags":["books","bitcoin","non-fiction","finance"],"categories":["books"],"contractType":"PHYSICAL_GOOD","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e****SIGNED COPY***** The Bitcoin Big Bang\u003c/em\u003e is a guide to navigating the uncharted territory of digital currency.

Just as the Internet has transformed dozens of industries - from media and entertainment to retailing, travel and many more - decentralized digital money, in the form of crypto-currencies, has the ability to transform the foundations of money, credit and financial services. It also has the power to transform other social activities and institutions that we don't usually associate directly with money, such as corporations, governance, voting and the law. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the first successful digital currency, bitcoin is the natural starting point for anyone interested in decentralized digital money, its implications and applications. Mastering Bitcoin describes the technical foundations of bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies, from cryptography basics, such as keys and addresses, to the data structures, network protocols and the consensus mechanism (\"mining\") that underpin bitcoin. Each technical topic is explained with user stories, elegant analogies and examples, and code snippets illustrating the key concepts. The first two chapters offer a broad and accessible introduction to bitcoin that is intended for all audiences, from new non-technical users to investors and business executives seeking to better understand bitcoin. The remainder of the book dives into the technical details of bitcoin's operation and is aimed at professional developers, engineers, software and systems architects, systems administrators and technically-minded people interested in the inner workings of bitcoin and comparable crypto-currencies. Mastering Bitcoin is intended to be used as a reference book for technical professionals, as a self-study guide for bitcoin entrepreneurs, and as a textbook for university courses on bitcoin and digital currencies. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eBitcoin is still in its infancy, and yet it has already spawned a multi-billion dollar, global economy that is growing exponentially.

The year is 2095 and the day is the one-hundredth birthday of Martha Washington. She is the leader of a small, resolute band that will not forfeit the pursuit of liberty-no matter what the cost. Today, the cost will be high. Martha has seen much in her hundred years, from the triumphs and tragedies of the battlefront, to the deepest reaches of space. Today, she will finally see the truth. Includes a special section of never-before-seen production sketches and drawings that predate Martha's first series, Give Me Liberty, along with Frank Miller's original plot notes, all wrapped inside a high-quality card stock cover.

Thomas Capcom's legendary action-horror franchise, Darkstalkers, continues its pulse-pounding epic tale as Donovan, the mysterious demon-hunting warrior-monk, arrives on the scene, driven by a shadowy past to fulfill a single purpose: destroy the Dark Ones who dare walk the Earth. His quest has taken him around the world and shown a great many horrible things, but none as great as the one he witnesses the young girl, Anita, endure. But even as he takes her under his wing, he senses a dark secret behind her cold, frozen eyes, and wonders if there will be any salvation for her soul. Meanwhile, Morrigan's mortal enemy, Demitri Maximov, may not be as dead as she once believed... PLUS!

As the world deals with the rise of paranormal activity, life has been much harder on those whose heritage lies somewhere between human and Darkstalker. Felicia, a cat-woman, has found it increasingly difficult to pursue her dreams of an acting career as society becomes less accepting of her kind. Meanwhile, the werewolf Talbain, hunted and hated for most of his life, has received even less tolerance. In this story featuring guest artist KEVIN (Iron Fist, Vampi) LAU and ALVIN (Street Fighter, Agent X) LEE, Felicia and Talbain's lives collide as one seeks to find peace with humanity while the other wishes to shun it.

Darkstalkers, the ongoing comic based on Capcom's classic series, continues this month with the tale of the Gerdenheim Monster: Victor. After years of failed experiments conducted in the bowels of his towering dark castle, Professor Gerdenheim was finally successful in discovering the secrets of life, death and reanimation. Fashioning a creature by integrating and enhancing body parts from countless corpses, Prof. Gerdenheim created \"Victor.\" He was overjoyed at the sight of his newly born creation, but many villagers accused the scientist of being mad to allow such an 'abomination' to walk the Earth.

Plus, it's in full-color, thanks to Han Allred, protégé of Wizard Fan Award-winner Laura Allred, and it has a cover collaboration between Mike and Chynna.
