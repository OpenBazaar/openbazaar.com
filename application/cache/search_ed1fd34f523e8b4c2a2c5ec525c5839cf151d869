Peter heads to the doctor with the sniffles and learns that Aunt May's health is very fragile; Spidey is roped into tangling with a bunch of goons who zap him with a mysterious gas; not realizing that the gas has weakened his spider sense, he changes into Peter Parker under the watchful gaze of the Green Goblin; the Goblin confronts Spidey outside of his home and captures him as Peter is worried that Aunt May might be overcome by the commotion; trussed up in the Goblin's lair, Peter is shocked when the Goblin takes off his mask and reveals himself to be Norman Osborn. According to Les Daniels in \"Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics\" (Abrams, 1991), artist Steve Ditko resigned because of a disagreement over the Goblin's identity. Ditko wanted it to be someone anonymous--a new, unknown guy; Lee wanted it to be a familiar character that would startle readers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","thumbnail":{"tiny":"zb2rhdZ8cC1Q1SVUVMh195gffM6cAYHXxmC6T1Su23SvRpHtS","small":"zb2rhjCtYgm8aDWwCkr7vigKsFQ6FA6VctJQ6rsL6ae7MSGW5","medium":"zb2rhd33QhwqWuXRz73FRNXQ5oK2T6H1UpQE3JiMTWAMjGKzg","original":"zdj7WbWDkPWWTmZZ8BwFSLZAxQV7pDybKnSZgFn3mjq6d5cQi","large":"zb2rhnWEcjj5hdbfCoSHAa4cqRPn6rWudNZx1gPwnK9eUUtnW"},"language":"","price":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":200},"nsfw":false,"averageRating":0,"ratingCount":0,"shipsTo":["UNITED_STATES","ALL"],"acceptedCurrencies":["BTC"],"coinType":"","coinDivisibility":0}},{"type":"listing","relationships":{"vendor":{"data":{"peerID":"QmakxNv9Y5YFuAuvjvx4mEda3TmFBaHDtacd1KtEL56mP4","name":"CryptoCollectibles","handle":"","location":"Blockchains and Webberverse","nsfw":false,"vendor":true,"moderator":false,"verifiedModerator":false,"about":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComic Books, Trades, Marvel, DC, Other Publishers, Single Issues, Sets, Runs, Collections, Autographed Items, Toys, Promotional Items, and Video Games\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll comics are shipped USPS Priority. \u0026nbsp;This includes Tracking and $50 of insurance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet up to 10 comics for one shipping cost! \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are ordering more than one comic book, just send a message using the OpenBazaar messaging system with what comic books you want to group together and we will generate a custom listing for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCheck out all our great reviews on our Etsy Store http://www.etsy.com/shop/CryptoCollectibles/reviews\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cem\u003ePLEASE PARDON OUR STARDUST AS THE STORE HAS \u003ca href=\"https://www.yours.org/content/hurricane-survivor-tips-by-bebop-and-boo-boo--hurricane-irma-survivors-47b0a9e6e43d/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSURVIVED A HURRICANE\u003c/a\u003e AND WE MOVE THINGS OVER FROM OPENBAZAAR 1.0 TO 2.0, THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE DURING THIS TRANSITION. \u0026nbsp;BASICALLY IMAGES AND CATEGORIES ARE A LITTLE WONKY. \u0026nbsp; I DIDN'T MEAN TO YELL, SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS, THANKS FOR CHECKING THE STORE OUT.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","shortDescription":"Blockchains Local Comic Shop","avatarHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhhus4hQpTbS3BYHvyhHcRbT8qvBHuEv4AtgD1jkC2oBNH","small":"zb2rhatvcGoep2LP4gv2CFWbnZF4Huo73JgT8A3bTbq83BMJ1","medium":"zb2rhkd9xfsM7V1wUL5sWguEF85U6mwhRiRG5TcLPsv18pi5v","original":"zb2rhkd9xfsM7V1wUL5sWguEF85U6mwhRiRG5TcLPsv18pi5v","large":"zb2rhcsyfmHCDvFypfJKZ8dXij8MenEeYynZYvUZKm6wiftzd"},"headerHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhbLVmugpRVc4uyH5uM35k6ihjku3dcCzA8NKXARpCZ1Rb","small":"zb2rhjsmyJ4h5KePDwWWu8YVea2NbCXNdrgE87H7h8fDPYeSN","medium":"zb2rhmr8TbqAMKh8eK98MEUijJeN6kh7XAvLbsz1hdXi1TXRf","original":"zb2rhoBtQaMVhauCrL2MovADpzRaWtNNkcyBBwbJNPTP91GPr","large":"zb2rhf5GzGmmZ8ejUYnZtouWjaLEWqFx3jN945PpjF2qh9cG9"},"userAgent":"/openbazaar-go:0.11.0/","lastSeen":"2018-04-17T11:49:17.700072146Z","stats":{"followerCount":280,"followingCount":58,"listingCount":2129,"postCount":0,"ratingCount":2,"averageRating":5},"currencies":null}},"moderators":[]},"data":{"score":0,"hash":"","slug":"uncanny-x-men-43-1968-comic-book","title":"Uncanny X-Men #43 (1968) Comic Book","tags":["uncanny-x-men","x-men","comic-books","marvel-comics","silver-age-comics","1968","john-buscema","roy-thomas","george-tuska","magneto"],"categories":["Comics","Single Issues","Marvel","Marvel - Mutants","Marvel - Single Issues"],"contractType":"PHYSICAL_GOOD","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eUncanny X-Men #43 (1968) by Marvel Comics\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCover pencils by John Buscema.

Saffron is said to be magical in the sense that it has assisted in bringing sick people back to good health. Not only is it beneficial to a person’s health, it is more commonly used to bring life to dishes and teas, adding a romantic and stimulating twist to whatever it is added to. Each region that grows saffron produces a distinctly different kind, and our saffron, in terms of taste, aroma and history, is the supreme class that can be sourced on earth.\u003c/p\u003e","thumbnail":{"tiny":"zb2rheQ46oHB5UoyvjYjp9n7sDNYoyYhHEd7SjrCvayai9RBR","small":"zb2rhXZ4REnY1EugAkQfZjcqncDVB8hRu4g7Q98Cwaj7TjXQK","medium":"zb2rhoB8vxewzYnC8rcD8BKXk7VCLvoEns7ibHoCpvDCkeC5R","original":"zb2rhZzQrELWJBuzHwt3M9z6Y8Fd33jUpns4mw5HVeynxVPvw","large":"zb2rhcFsKfTZjFBpxNqif3c5xVQUm5GUY5cvBdBwyJwmLAZvx"},"language":"","price":{"currencyCode":"AUD","amount":3499},"nsfw":false,"averageRating":0,"ratingCount":0,"shipsTo":["ALL"],"acceptedCurrencies":["BTC"],"coinType":"","coinDivisibility":0}},{"type":"listing","relationships":{"vendor":{"data":{"peerID":"QmTgBipTYUMVh3UMKehxMQrmvra7StTb8GsWFKgYPa57km","name":"Safmard","handle":"","location":"Australia","nsfw":false,"vendor":true,"moderator":true,"verifiedModerator":false,"about":"\u003cp\u003eSaffron Expert\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWholesale saffron up to 50 kg\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRetail saffron packs from 0.5 grams\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePremium quality Grade-1 all red saffron\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","shortDescription":"Saffron Expert","avatarHashes":{"tiny":"","small":"","medium":"","original":"","large":""},"headerHashes":{"tiny":"zb2rhXnxzMhV9QPqYPkF759rTckE5nejmWZFEuD3jC9MEf7Rg","small":"zb2rhcUnhxqKhezhLLYpgBpPk4mwfWQfSbe6Lzt83GVkcVxpv","medium":"zb2rheQuLundfKd7r2Ydfe38VTCQJ6bZn6yr6pmoJop1qvR38","original":"zb2rhmRQdVY2vGEFnYCfD3Ls5RopKgDmzRS75w7Di9xkH7Hn3","large":"zb2rhYmrw7Xy1yGYdDegaWgRW1XbDdYHWP37YXTF6UdAoQHik"},"userAgent":"/openbazaar-go:0.11.1/","lastSeen":"2018-04-17T13:23:54.53855757Z","stats":{"followerCount":19,"followingCount":2,"listingCount":9,"postCount":0,"ratingCount":0,"averageRating":0},"currencies":null}},"moderators":[]},"data":{"score":0,"hash":"","slug":"grade-1-bulk-saffron-25-grams","title":"Grade-1 Bulk Saffron - 25 grams","tags":["saffron","buy-saffron","spice","grocerreis","persian-saffron"],"categories":["Premium Saffron"],"contractType":"PHYSICAL_GOOD","description":"\u003ch2\u003eBuy in bulk and save!\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 25g package is best suited to someone that uses saffron on a daily basis.

It is native throughout the Mediterranean but is mainly cultivated in France and Spain. The plant can reach over 60cm in height and in summer it is covered in clusters of bright yellow flowers. The flowers retain their colour after picking and are often used in dried flower arrangements or pot pourri, hence their name ‘Everlasting’ or ‘Immortal’.
